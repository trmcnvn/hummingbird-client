##### Format

Posts on Kitsu use the [Markdown](http://commonmark.org/help/) format, although we have limits on what is allowed.

| Type | Or | ... to get |
|------|----|------------|
| \*Italic* | \_Italic_ | *Italic* |
| \*\*bold** | \_\_bold__ | **Bold** |
| \[Link](https://a.com) | [Link][1]<br>...<br>[1]: https://a.com | [Link](https://a.com) |           
| \`Inline code\` | | `Inline code` |
| \```<br># code block<br>\``` | | ```code block``` |

We'll also convert any URLs that you write in plaintext into usable links.

##### Embeds

You can only have **ONE** embed per post. If your post contains multiple links, we'll embed the first link but you'll be able to change which link will be embedded or choose to not have any embed.

##### Uploads

We support uploading images in the following formats:

```
PNG, JPG, GIF
```

You can to upload up to 20 images per post. Your post can only have uploads **OR** an embed, not both.

##### Tagging Media

When you tag a media to your post, the post will also be posted to that specific media's feed and surface up to other users on Kitsu who have an interest in that media.

You're also able to tag a specific episode/chapter, in which case the post will also be posted to that episode/chapter's feed.
