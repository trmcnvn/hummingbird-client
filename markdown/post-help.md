##### Format

Posts on Kitsu use the [Markdown](http://commonmark.org/help/) format, although we have limits on what is allowed.

| Type | Or | ... to get |
|------|----|------------|
| \*Italic* | \_Italic_ | *Italic* |
| \*\*bold** | \_\_bold__ | **Bold** |
| \[Link](https://a.com) | [Link][1]<br>...<br>[1]: https://a.com | [Link](https://a.com) |           
| \!\[Image](http://url/a.png) | ![Image][1]<br>...<br>[1]: http://url/a.png | ![Image](/favicon-32x32.png) |
| \`Inline code\` | | `Inline code` |
| \```<br># code block<br>\``` | | ```code block``` |

We'll also convert any URLs that you write in plaintext into usable links.

##### Embeds

You're only allowed to have **ONE** embed per post. If your post contains multiple links, you can clear the embeds until the editor previews the embed of the link that you're after.

You can also choose to clear all of the embeds, if you'd rather not embed anything.

##### Uploads

We support uploading images in the following formats:

    PNG, JPG, GIF

You're allowed to upload up to 20 images per post. You can only have uploads **OR** an embed, not both.

##### Tagging Media

When you tag a media to your post, it will also be posted to the specific media's feed and surface up to other users on Kitsu who have an interest in that media.

You're also able to tag a specific episode of a media, in which case the post will also be posted to that episode's feed.
