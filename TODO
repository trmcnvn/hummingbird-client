General:
  ☐ Create an `empty-state` component rather than using text.
  ☐ Create an addon that transpiles Markdown files to HTML at build time
  ☐ Create a decorator that allows routes to transition to `/404` when a model request fails
  ☐ Meta tags breadcrumbs (Port from v3)
  ☐ Make sure errors are being sent to Sentry

Issues:
  ☐ Signing in sometimes gets locked up, is it the `waitForProperty` yield?
  ☐ Is it better to only create Modals in the DOM when they are invoked?

Dashboard:
  Quick Update:
    ☐ Completed State
    ☐ Edit Library Entries
    ☐ Link to unit page

Explore:
  ☐ Build the advanced search pages to be backed by Algolia search

Editor:
  ☐ Implement the `user-selector` component
  ☐ Build a mapping for mentions. Some uses don't have a `slug` and `id's` look ugly. (Name <-> linkableId)

Feed:
  ☐ Review component
  ☐ Reaction component
  ☐ Follow component

Ideas:
  ☐ Look into modifying editor to fork the store and modify a post record directly instead of many attributes
